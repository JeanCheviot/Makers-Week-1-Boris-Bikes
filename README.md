#Boris Bikes#

This is the repository for Week One of  Makers Academy, a challenge centerd around Boris Bikes.  As we are pair programming we will be swapping between members of the group on a regular basis to ensure all experience the driver/navigator role.
We aim to spend no more than 30mins before role rotation.

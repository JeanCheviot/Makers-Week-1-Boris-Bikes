Type of error: Uninitialized constant (DockingStation)
The file path where error happened: /users/frankiebell/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.3.1/bin/irb:11:in 
Line number of error: Line 1
Error means: We haven't created a DockingStation class and therefore IRB doesn't understand what we are asking it to do. 
One solution: Create a .rb file, create a class and then 'require' that file in irb
